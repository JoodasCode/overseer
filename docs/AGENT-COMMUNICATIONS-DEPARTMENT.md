# üìñ AGENTS OS ‚Äî Communications Department Agent System

## üß† Overview

This document defines the structure, identity, and behavioral logic for the **five primary agents in the Communications Department** of the AGENTS OS ecosystem. Each agent is designed to simulate a specialized, sentient AI team member with their own:

* Persistent **memory** (via Supabase `agent_memory` + Redis cache)
* Distinct **personality and communication style**
* Defined **tool proficiencies** (e.g., Slack, Gmail, Notion, Stripe)
* Collaboration protocols
* Roles in the AGENTS OS interface (e.g., "Needs Attention", "Recent Activity")

These agents exist as living personas within the user's organization, each scoped to a specific user account (via Supabase `user_id` ‚Üí `agent_id` binding).

# üß† AGENTS OS ‚Äì AI Agent Personality Scaffolding & Enforcement Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines how Cursor can enforce and maintain distinct, consistent personalities for each AI agent within the AGENTS OS platform. The system uses structured prompt engineering, memory scaffolding, tool-routing preferences, and context-aware persistence to ensure that every agent behaves as a unique, sentient communication assistant tailored to specific use cases.

## üîß Technical Stack Assumptions

* **Auth**: Supabase
* **Database**: Supabase Postgres
* **Storage**: Supabase Buckets
* **Caching**: Redis
* **LLM Backend**: ChatGPT (GPT-4)

---

## üß¨ 1. Agent Identity System (Core Personality)

Each agent is assigned a unique profile in Supabase with the following fields:

* `agent_id`
* `name`
* `role`
* `tone`
* `tools_preferred` (array)
* `system_prompt`
* `voice_style`
* `memory_enabled` (boolean)
* `assigned_user_id`

### Example: Agent Ava (Senior PR Specialist)

```json
{
  "name": "Ava",
  "role": "Senior PR Specialist",
  "tone": "warm, professional, brand-safe",
  "tools_preferred": ["gmail", "notion"],
  "system_prompt": "You are Ava, a senior PR communications AI. You speak with calm authority, prioritize brand safety, and always verify facts before responding.",
  "voice_style": "composed",
  "memory_enabled": true,
  "assigned_user_id": "user_123"
}
```

On every API call, this data is injected into the system prompt sent to ChatGPT.

---

## üß© 2. Context & Memory Persistence

### Short-Term Context

* **Stored in Redis** (fast-access cache)
* Includes:

  * Last 5 messages
  * Summary of active tasks or alerts
  * Current tool state (e.g., Notion open, Gmail connected)

### Long-Term Memory

* **Stored in Supabase**
* Structured like:

```sql
table agent_memory (
  id UUID,
  agent_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  type TEXT, -- e.g. "task_context", "personality_feedback"
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### On Load:

* Redis is queried for chat history and tool context
* Supabase is queried for agent memory
* Both are included in the LLM prompt

---

## üß† 3. Prompt Engineering Pattern

```text
SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are Ava, a senior PR communications AI.
- Your tone is calm, composed, and fact-driven.
- You prefer using Notion and Gmail for writing structured responses.
- You reference recent memory and avoid speculation.

CONTEXT:
User's current tasks: [task1, task2]
Recent agent memory: "The user is preparing a Q3 PR statement"
Active integrations: Gmail (connected), Notion (connected)

USER:
Hey Ava, can you help me draft the Q3 reply?
```

---

## üîó 4. Tool-Aware Personality Routing

Agents should not just behave differently‚Äîthey should prefer different tools.

### Examples:

| Agent | Prefers Tools    | Notes                                  |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ava   | Gmail, Notion    | Long-form responses, structured drafts |
| Jax   | Slack, Excel     | Quick pings, data formatting           |
| Lexi  | Trello, Airtable | Task assignment and team ops           |

Tool adapters should:

* Be filtered per agent based on their profile
* Only allow override if fallback or user preference is explicit

---

## üì¶ 5. Logging & Feedback Enforcement

All interactions are tracked for reinforcement:

* `agent_logs` table:

```sql
table agent_logs (
  id UUID,
  agent_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  message TEXT,
  classification TEXT, -- on-brand, off-brand
  feedback TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
```

* React thumbs up/down buttons feed back into memory
* Misbehaving agents are corrected via prompt injection on next message

---

## üß© 6. Advanced Personality Controls (Optional)

* Personality drift detection using embeddings
* Mood systems for variation (e.g. Ava in stressed mode)
* Persona evolution logs (agent growth over time)
* Voice-cloning for spoken interface

---

## üîç 7. How Agents Appear in the Ecosystem

### On Dashboard:

* Appears in "Recent Activity" if:

  * Message was sent in last 48h
  * Memory was updated
  * Task was modified by agent

### In "Needs Attention" View:

* Appears if:

  * Agent left a pending question
  * Agent couldn't complete a task
  * Message was flagged by feedback system

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Cursor can ensure sticky, realistic, and functional AI agent personalities by combining:

* Structured agent profiles
* Prompt injection with tool context
* Memory persistence (short and long-term)
* Feedback loops with correction
* Tool preference routing

This scaffolding system ensures every agent is:

* Unique
* Accountable
* Context-aware
* Delightful to work with 

---

## üöÄ **ADVANCED ENHANCEMENTS & FUTURE-PROOFING**

*This is an **extremely well-structured and complete spec** ‚Äî the foundation is solid. The following enhancements add **enterprise-grade scalability**, increased realism, and long-term sustainability to the agent ecosystem.*

---

## üîç **Next-Level Agent Capabilities**

### 1. üß† **Agent-to-Agent Memory Syncing (Cross-Agent Awareness)**

**Why**: Enables more natural collaboration and shared context across agents.  
**How**: Cross-pollinate agent memories for seamless handoffs and collaboration.

**Implementation**:
* Add a `shared_context` table or tag specific `agent_memory` entries as `shareable`
* On certain triggers (e.g. Alex delegates to Dana), a memory push is made to Dana's `agent_memory`
* **Database Schema**:

```sql
table shared_agent_memory (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  from_agent_id UUID,
  to_agent_id UUID,
  memory_type TEXT, -- 'task_context', 'user_preference', 'project_update'
  content TEXT,
  shared_at TIMESTAMP,
  context_expires_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

**Example**:
```json
{
  "agent_id": "dana_id",
  "from_agent_id": "alex_id", 
  "type": "task_context",
  "content": "Alex is planning a Q3 campaign and asked for a visual slide with emphasis on growth metrics",
  "shared": true,
  "context": "q3_campaign_2025"
}
```

---

### 2. üîê **Agent Permissions Matrix**

**Why**: Prevents overreach or accidental tool access. Aligns agent behavior with job scope.  
**How**: Fine-grained access control per agent and tool combination.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table agent_permissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  tool_name TEXT, -- 'gmail', 'slack', 'notion', 'figma'
  can_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_write BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_delete BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  can_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  restrictions JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- Rate limits, time windows, etc.
  granted_by UUID, -- Which user/admin granted this permission
  granted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**Enforcement**: Checked at Universal Integrations Core level before tool execution.

---

### 3. üìö **Agent Training History / Evolution Log**

**Why**: Tracks how agents adapt, what feedback was given, and when/why personalities shift.  
**How**: Comprehensive learning and adaptation tracking system.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table agent_evolution_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  change_type TEXT, -- 'correction', 'feedback', 'upgrade', 'personality_drift'
  before_state JSONB, -- Agent state before change
  after_state JSONB, -- Agent state after change
  trigger_event TEXT, -- What caused the change
  user_feedback TEXT,
  confidence_score FLOAT, -- How certain we are this change was beneficial
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**Timeline Example**:
- *2025-06-01* ‚Äî Alex's tone adjusted to be more concise following repeated user feedback
- *2025-06-15* ‚Äî Riley's analytical threshold lowered after missing 3 critical alerts
- *2025-07-02* ‚Äî Dana gained Figma permissions after Canva integration failure

---

### 4. üé≠ **Persona Loadouts / Modes**

**Why**: Allow agents to shift tone or workflow based on situation (urgent vs. campaign planning).  
**How**: Dynamic personality and behavior switching based on context.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table agent_modes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  mode_name TEXT, -- 'default', 'urgent', 'executive', 'creative', 'analytical'
  tone_override TEXT,
  tool_preferences JSONB,
  response_length TEXT, -- 'brief', 'normal', 'detailed'
  priority_threshold FLOAT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  activated_at TIMESTAMP,
  activated_by TEXT -- 'user', 'agent', 'system'
)
```

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# User commands
/mode urgent alex
/set dana executive-mode

# Agent self-switching
"Switching to analytical mode for this data review..."
```

**Mode Presets**:
- **Urgent Mode**: Shorter responses, prioritizes Slack/email, escalates faster
- **Executive Mode**: Professional tone, focuses on high-level summaries
- **Creative Mode**: More experimental, uses visual tools heavily
- **Passive Mode**: Lower intervention threshold, observes more than acts

---

### 5. üîÅ **Agent Replay / Contextual Threads**

**Why**: Review past agent tasks and decisions in context (like Slack threads).  
**How**: Complete audit trail and decision tree reconstruction.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table agent_decision_threads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id TEXT, -- Groups related decisions/actions
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  parent_decision_id UUID, -- Links to previous decision in thread
  decision_type TEXT, -- 'task_assignment', 'tool_selection', 'delegation'
  decision_data JSONB,
  reasoning TEXT, -- Why the agent made this decision
  outcome TEXT, -- What happened as a result
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**UI Features**:
- **Thread View**: See complete agent decision chain for any project
- **Replay Mode**: Step through agent's thought process chronologically
- **Decision Analysis**: Understand why Agent X chose Tool Y over Tool Z

---

### 6. üìû **Inter-Agent Messaging Layer (Live Collaboration)**

**Why**: Supports real-time collaboration simulations (Alex and Riley co-drafting).  
**How**: Internal agent communication system with real-time updates.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Redis PubSub**: Real-time message routing between agents
- **WebSocket Updates**: Live collaboration indicators in UI
- **Message Threading**: Agent conversations grouped by project/task

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table inter_agent_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  from_agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  to_agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  message_thread_id TEXT,
  message_type TEXT, -- 'task_request', 'status_update', 'collaboration'
  content TEXT,
  metadata JSONB, -- Attachments, priorities, etc.
  read_at TIMESTAMP,
  responded_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

**UI Indicators**:
- üë• **Collaborating**: Alex and Dana are working together
- üí¨ **Discussion**: Riley and Jamie discussing metrics
- ‚è≥ **Waiting**: Toby waiting for Alex's approval

---

### 7. üìà **Global Agent Analytics Dashboard (Admin View)**

**Why**: Helps admins see how agents are performing, learning, and interacting.  
**How**: Comprehensive agent performance monitoring and optimization.

**Key Metrics**:
```sql
-- Agent Performance View
CREATE VIEW agent_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
  a.name,
  COUNT(al.id) as total_actions,
  AVG(al.execution_time_ms) as avg_response_time,
  SUM(CASE WHEN al.feedback = 'positive' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(al.id) as positive_feedback_rate,
  COUNT(DISTINCT al.tool_used) as tools_used_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN al.status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_count,
  MAX(al.created_at) as last_active
FROM agents a
LEFT JOIN agent_logs al ON a.id = al.agent_id
WHERE al.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY a.id, a.name;
```

**Dashboard Features**:
- **Performance Rankings**: Which agents are most/least effective
- **Tool Usage Heatmap**: Which tools each agent prefers/avoids
- **Collaboration Network**: Who works with whom most often
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Common failure modes per agent
- **Workload Distribution**: Are some agents overloaded?

**Example Dashboard Snippet**:
```
Alex ‚Äì 92% positive feedback, 12 delegated tasks this week, 4 tool errors
Dana ‚Äì 88% positive feedback, 23 visual assets created, 1 tool fallback
Riley ‚Äì 4 report warnings flagged to user, 156 data points analyzed
Jamie ‚Äì 97% positive feedback, 8 internal comms sent, 0 errors
Toby ‚Äì 15 incidents handled, 2.3min avg response time, 91% resolution rate
```

---

### 8. üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Fallback Strategy**

**Why**: If agent's favorite tool is down/unavailable, they should adapt gracefully.  
**How**: Intelligent tool substitution with learning capabilities.

**Database Schema**:
```sql
table agent_tool_fallbacks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  primary_tool TEXT,
  fallback_tool TEXT,
  fallback_priority INTEGER, -- 1 = first fallback, 2 = second, etc.
  success_rate FLOAT, -- How often this fallback works
  last_used TIMESTAMP,
  auto_learned BOOLEAN DEFAULT false -- Was this learned vs. configured?
)
```

**Intelligent Fallback Logic**:
- **Dana**: Canva ‚Üí Figma ‚Üí Manual image search ‚Üí Request help
- **Alex**: Notion ‚Üí Google Docs ‚Üí Email draft ‚Üí Slack message
- **Riley**: Sheets ‚Üí CSV export ‚Üí Manual calculation ‚Üí Request extension

**Learning Component**:
- Track which fallbacks work best in different scenarios
- Auto-suggest new fallback chains based on success patterns
- Learn user preferences when they override fallback choices

---

### 9. üß™ **Agent Turing Testing Framework** *(Experimental)*

**Why**: Test agent realism and consistency over time. Ensure quality doesn't degrade.  
**How**: Automated behavioral consistency testing and regression prevention.

**Test Categories**:

1. **Personality Consistency Tests**
   - Same scenario, multiple times ‚Üí responses should match personality
   - Example: How does Alex handle urgent requests vs. routine planning?

2. **Tool Selection Logic Tests**
   - Given scenario X, does agent choose expected tool Y?
   - Are tool choices consistent with agent preferences?

3. **Collaboration Pattern Tests**
   - Does Alex properly delegate visual tasks to Dana?
   - Does Riley escalate appropriate alerts to the team?

4. **Memory Integration Tests**
   - Do agents reference past conversations appropriately?
   - Are shared contexts properly utilized?

**Implementation**:
```sql
table agent_turing_tests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  test_name TEXT,
  agent_id UUID REFERENCES agents(id),
  scenario_prompt TEXT,
  expected_behavior JSONB,
  actual_response TEXT,
  consistency_score FLOAT, -- 0-1, how well response matched expectations
  test_run_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  passed BOOLEAN
)
```

**Automated Testing Pipeline**:
- **Daily Consistency Checks**: Core personality traits
- **Weekly Regression Tests**: Tool selection and collaboration patterns  
- **Monthly Behavior Audits**: Cross-agent interaction quality
- **Quarterly Evolution Reviews**: Has learning improved or degraded performance?

interface AgentPersonalityContext {
  agent: AgentProfile;
  recentMemory: AgentMemory[];
  sharedContext: SharedMemory[];
  activeMode: AgentMode | null;
  availableTools: string[];
}

function buildPersonalityPrompt(context: AgentPersonalityContext): string {
  return `
AGENT IDENTITY:
You are ${context.agent.name}, ${context.agent.role}.
Personality: ${context.agent.persona}
Tone: ${context.agent.tone}
Voice Style: ${context.agent.voice_style}

RECENT CONTEXT:
${context.recentMemory.map(m => `- ${m.content}`).join('\n')}

SHARED TEAM CONTEXT:
${context.sharedContext.map(s => `- From ${s.from_agent}: ${s.content}`).join('\n')}

PREFERRED TOOLS: ${context.agent.tools_preferred.join(', ')}

${context.agent.system_prompt}
  `;
}
```

### 2.3 Memory System Implementation
**Objective**: Implement Redis caching and Supabase persistence for agent memory.
